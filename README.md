# Metaflow

Metaflow is a comprehensive schema visualization and management tool designed to help developers and database administrators understand, explore, and manage database schemas with ease. The project provides a unified view of multiple database schemas, allowing users to visualize relationships between tables, explore table metadata, and generate AI-powered descriptions for schema elements. With an intuitive user interface and powerful backend, Metaflow simplifies database schema exploration and documentation.

## Features

1. **Unified Schema Visualization**:
   - Visualize multiple database schemas in a single, unified graph.
   - Highlight relationships between tables using foreign keys.
   - Interactive graph with zoom, pan, and node selection.

2. **Table Exploration**:
   - View detailed metadata for each table, including column names, data types, and primary keys.
   - Explore table data with a preview of the first 100 rows.

3. **AI-Powered Descriptions**:
   - Generate short, meaningful descriptions for schema elements (tables and columns) using AI.
   - Edit and regenerate descriptions as needed.

4. **Search and Filter**:
   - Search for tables or columns by name.
   - Highlight matching nodes in the graph for quick navigation.

5. **Export Metadata**:
   - Export schema metadata in JSON or YAML format for documentation or sharing.

6. **Responsive and Modern UI**:
   - Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive user interface.
   - Smooth animations and transitions for an enhanced user experience.

## Usage

### Schema Visualization
- The main graph displays all tables and their relationships.
- Click on a table node to view its details in the side panel.

### Table Details
- In the side panel, you can view:
  - Table metadata (columns, data types, primary keys).
  - A preview of the table data.
  - AI-generated descriptions for columns.

### AI-Powered Descriptions
- Click the "Generate Description" button to create a short description for a table or column.
- Edit or regenerate descriptions as needed.

### Export Metadata
- Use the "Export Metadata" button to download schema metadata in JSON or YAML format.
